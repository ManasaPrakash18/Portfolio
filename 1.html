About GIT
</h1>
<pre>
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.
It enables collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
Key commands include git init (initialize a repository), git add (stage changes), git commit (save changes), git push (upload to remote), and git pull (fetch updates).
Branching in Git allows developers to work on features independently and merge them back into the main codebase.
Git is widely used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab for hosting and managing repositories online.
